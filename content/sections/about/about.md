Hello World. I am a scholar at SUTD in my junior year, majoring in Computer Science and Design and intending to speciliase in Software Engineering and Data Analytics. 

I've always been up for challenges and the evolving coding landscape had to be one of them. I saw myself as a creator of technology and not just its user. And as I started coding, it was hard for me to even catch the syntax, let alone the logic. But I perservered & this website is the result of my never give up spirit, and so are the various projects here. 

Despite being strongly mathematical and logical, what differentiates me from a mere cs student is my design skills. It is through design I have understood that technology cannot be harnessed without the human touch. Thus, I co-founded a tech-based social enterprise as Chief of Finance which garnered seed funding from the prestigious SUTD MIT IDC and JP Morgan Design Odyssey Program. Building software that my clients look forward to using and that contributes positively to the world drives me to do better everyday.


Enough said, now is your time to explore my world. Enjoy exploring! :)
